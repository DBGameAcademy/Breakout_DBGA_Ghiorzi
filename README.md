## The game

The game is a rivisited version of the classic arcade game Atari Breakout.

Score as many points as you can by destroying blokcs with the ball!
Remember to always catch the ball if you don't want to lose!

Will you be able to destroy all blocks by taking advantage of the new power ups?

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.26f1 (or greater)

## How to play

In order to play the game, you can download the project and go to: **Breakout_DBGA_Ghiorzi > Build** and run the application: **Breakout.exe**

The commands are really simple:
